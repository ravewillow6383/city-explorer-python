**Author**: Raven W. Robertson
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview


## Getting Started
I'll be writing this code in python in a pipenv shell. 

## Architecture
I built this application using python3. I installed python dotenv and requests for my dependancies in this project. 
I've added flask and flask_cors to my list of used dependancies

## API
have a .env file containgin API keys from dark sky and from google geo code. 

## Change Log
12:03am 7/16/19-->I think I have this built up but I'm having a load of trouble getting requests and dotenv installed, or maybe just the piplock package installed? Need to look into this tomorrow. 
12:44am 7/17/19 I think again that I have everything built but I'm having trouble again with my dependancies. Can't get flask to run or install cors.
